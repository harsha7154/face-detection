# face-detection
Face detection using OpenCV involves identifying and locating human faces in images or video. It uses classifiers like Haar Cascades or deep learning-based models (e.g., DNN with Caffe or TensorFlow). These models scan the input to detect facial features, enabling tasks like recognition, tracking, or analysis.
